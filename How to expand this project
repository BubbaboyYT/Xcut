Right below the "if command == "CUTO":" and the "module = input("Module")" line add a if statment like this "if module == "xcut_propt":"
Right below your new found IF statment add some lines of code like the ones below this line
 xcutpropte = True
 while xcutpropte == True: 
     print("xcut Propt Terminal\n")
     xcut_propt_cmd = input("Command :") # hint, the varible xcut_propt_cmd is the command input and the varible xcutpropte enables \ disable the modules Terminal. Keep track of the varible names that you set these to cause dont use the one's I made
Then add a end command to enter back into the Xcut Terminal like the lines below this
if xcut_propt_cmd == "end":
    xcutpropte = False
Then to add a command add a IF statment like this with code below it (Dont froget to add Indents cause Python)
if xcut_propt_cmd == "HW":
  print("Hello world")
 Theres a lot more to that you can do. The only limit? Your coding skills
